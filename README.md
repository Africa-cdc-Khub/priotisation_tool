The Africa CDC Disease Prioritisation Tool is a decision-support platform designed to help countries identify and rank priority diseases based on key public health criteria. It enables evidence-based decision-making by assessing factors such as disease burden, epidemic potential, economic impact, and health system capacity.

The tool supports national and regional health authorities in focusing resources on the most critical diseases, strengthening preparedness, and guiding policy and investment for surveillance, response, and control efforts.
